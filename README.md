# GAIM2
Concurrent implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to optimize the travelling salesman problem

# Purpose
This branch lets you trigger every single step of the execution. After each generation the code is
paused and will continue after the user pressed _enter_. So, it is easier to obtain data and to follow how the algorithm evolves.
